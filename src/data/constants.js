It integrated an API for dynamic pizza menu loading and allowed user input without accounts, including basic details and optional GPS location. A priority marking feature was added for expedited delivery at 20% extra cost. Orders were submitted through a REST API with payments on delivery, and unique order IDs were generated for tracking and post-placement prioritization.",
